      "content": "**Simple Python Code Example: Guessing Game**\n\nHere's an example of a simple guessing game implemented in Python:\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guessing_game():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    \n    # Initialize the number of attempts\n    attempts = 0\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n        \n        try:\n            # Try to convert the user's input to an integer\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n            \n            # Increment the number of attempts\n            attempts += 1\n            \n            # Check if the user's guess is correct\n            if user_guess < number_to_guess:\n                print(\"Too low! Try again.\")\n            elif user_guess > number_to_guess:\n                print(\"Too high! Try again.\")\n            else:\n                print(f\"Congratulations! You found the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n                break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guessing_game()\n```\nThis code uses a `while` loop to repeatedly ask the user for their guess until they correctly guess the number.\n\n**Example Use Case:**\n\n1. Run the code in your Python interpreter or IDE.\n2. Read the instructions and take a guess!\n3. The program will provide feedback on whether your guess is too high or too low, and you can try again.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
